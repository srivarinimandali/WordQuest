- Select all JAR files in the folder and click *Open*, then Apply and Close.
6. Set Run Configuration
- Right-click the project in the Project Explorer and select Run As -> Run Configurations... .
- Under Java Application, select your main class.
- On the Arguments tab, in the VM arguments field, enter the following (modify the path to match where your JavaFX SDK `lib` folder is located):

                                     --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
 
- Click Apply and then Run to start your application.

Running the Project

With all configurations set, you can now run your JavaFX application directly from Eclipse:
- Ensure your main class is correctly set with a main method.
